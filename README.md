# Thiguka Language

**Thiguka** is a constructed language created by Lemuria in 2024.

This organization, while currently empty, may at some point host resources related to Thiguka, such as papers documenting certain aspects of the language, dictionaries, and an Anki card deck (as soon as it is large enough).
